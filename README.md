Strong impact on chance of success

Fixed mindset: first try fails, never will.

Struggling = growth

Questiong abilities? reflect on past success.

### Learning process
Focus mode: concious focusing, learning, reading, watching

Diffuse mode: subconcious (dishes, exercise, sleeping). in this state, mind connects new material

Stuck? take a break (let subconcious make connections). Put effort into problem first, then break

Understand it, practice it, and finally teach it

### AI code generation
- Large language models (LLM)
- Generative AIs code completion (Github Copilot)
- Code generation (ChatGPT)

Cons:
1. Learners miss the why and how
2. Delays skill of asking good questions to people and talking about your code
4. Needs scrunity. Beginners unsure if output is good or bad

Not recommended for learning. Can result in knowledge gaps.

### Manage study time
Consistency over working once/twice a week.

Study everyday, specific time with specific goal.

Stress anxiety do not help learning. Relax, don't worry, enjoy the ride, learn.

### Pitfalls to avoid
-procrastination > pomodoro

25 minutes, 5 minute break
4 25 minutes, 15-30 minute break

useful breaks: music, journal, doodle, meditate, quick game, short walk outside

-email, social media notifcations break focus and cause procrastination. avoid during study time > turn off notifcations, add blocker

- physical distraction like tv or people talking > find quiet place, noise cancelling, public and university libraries. surroundings instill sense of productivity

-counter productive note taking > make notes that serve as prompts for further research
