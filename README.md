## AI code generation
- Large language models (LLM)

Cons:
1. Learners miss the why and how

4. Needs scrunity. Beginners unsure if output is good or bad

Not recommended for learning. Creates knowledge gaps.

Consistency over working once/twice a week.

Study everyday, specific time with specific goal.

Stress anxiety do not help learning. Relax, don't worry, enjoy the ride, learn.

### No breaks
Burnout, lower productivity

**Useful breaks:** music, journal, doodle, meditate, quick game, short walk outside

### Email, social media
Avoid during study time. Notifcations off, add blocker

### Physical distraction

Quiet, noise cancelling, public/university libraries - instill sense of productivity
