## Career types
- Large tech: tough hiring, great pay/benefits

- Startups: "wild west", longer hours, equity, unique environment 

- Freelance > custom hourly wage, flex schedule, more time finding work & billing. Need strong people skills

- Web consultancy: focus more on code, good work/life balance

- Large, older companies: large tech but slower

## Everyday tools
Google, editor, command line, stack overflow, git, github

## Motivation
`discord: odin-success-stories`

## Growth mindset
Strong impact on chance of success

**Fixed mindset:** first try fails, never will. 

**Growth mindset:** get better at anything with effort and persistence.

Struggling = growth

Questiong abilities? reflect on past success.

## Learning process
**Focus mode:** concious focusing, learning, reading, watching

**Diffuse mode:** subconcious (dishes, exercise, sleeping). in this state, mind connects new material

Stuck? Take a break (diffuse mode). Put effort into problem first

Understand it, practice it, and finally teach it

## AI code generation
- Large language models (LLM)
- Generative AIs code completion (Github Copilot)
- Code generation (ChatGPT)

Cons:
1. Learners miss the why and how
2. Delays skill of asking good questions to people and talking about your code
4. Needs scrunity. Beginners unsure if output is good or bad

Not recommended for learning. Creates knowledge gaps.

## Manage study time
Consistency over working once/twice a week.

Study everyday, specific time with specific goal.

Stress anxiety do not help learning. Relax, don't worry, enjoy the ride, learn.

## Pitfalls to avoid
### Procrastination

Pomodoro: 25 minutes, 5 minute break<br/>
Four 25 minutes, 15-30 minute break<br/>

### No breaks
Burnout, lower productivity

**Useful breaks:** music, journal, doodle, meditate, quick game, short walk outside

### Email, social media
Avoid during study time. Notifcations off, add blocker

### Physical distraction
TV or people talking

Quiet, noise cancelling, public/university libraries - instill sense of productivity

### Counter productive note taking
Better: notes that prompt for further research

## Before asking for help
Stuck? Break. Rubber duck debugging, Google, Discord search function

## Getting help
- Just ask
- Provide code and context (see below)
- Readable format (backticks)
- Ask about the problem, not solution
- Share screenshot
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)

Context:
What do you think the problem is?
What exactly do you want to happen?
What is actually happening?
How did you get there?
What have you tried so far?

Completely stuck? Ask where to start and what to research to get started

## Helping others
1. Guide instead of answer (probing questions)
2. Help when certain 
3. One person at a time
4. When there's free time
5. Adapt expectations to their level
6. Ignore googleable questions
7. Answer question before raising other problems
8. Try debugger
9. Admit if problem is beyond your knowledge
10. Patience
11. Frustrated? Politely duck out.
