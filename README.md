### learning process
focus mode - concious focusing, learning, reading, watching

diffuse mode - subconcious (dishes, exercise, sleeping). in this state, mind connects new material

when stuck, take a break, let subconcious make connections. put effort into problem first, then break

understand it, practice it, and finally teach it

### when stuck
google, take a break (diffuse mode), discord chat

### ai code generation
large language models (LLM)
generative AIs code completion (Github Copilot)
code generation (chatGPT)

Can result in knowledge gaps:
1. learners miss the why and how
2. delays skill of asking questions to people
3. also skill of talking about your code
4. beginners unsure if output is good or bad

AI tools not recommended for learning

### manage study time
consistency over working once/twice a week.
study everyday, specific time with specific goal will make progress

stress anxiety do not help learning. relax, enjoy the ride, dont worry, learn.

### pitfalls to avoid

25 minutes, 5 minute break
4 25 minutes, 15-30 minute break

-not taking breaks
leads to burnout, lower productivity

useful breaks: music, journal, doodle, meditate, quick game, short walk outside

-email, social media notifcations break focus and cause procrastination. avoid during study time > turn off notifcations, add blocker

- physical distraction like tv or people talking > find quiet place, noise cancelling, public and university libraries. surroundings instill sense of productivity

-counter productive note taking > make notes that serve as prompts for further research
